Sara's Awesome Reddit Scraper
=============

My friend Sara wanted to grab Reddit comments for some work she's doing for her thesis. She was previously using
a web service that dumped Youtube comments into csvs and described the service to me. She does her work in Excel.

Without knowing a whole lot more than that, I wanted to very quickly hack up a website that could offer the same
functionality for Reddit comments, with the added bonus of outputting nicely formatted Excel spreadsheets.

The service and frontend were completed in a day; I wanted to demostrate the Power Of Python and open the door
to questions about how programming can solve all you problems, if your problems are scraping Reddit comments and
processing the data.
